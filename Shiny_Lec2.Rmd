## Lession 2 Build a User Interface ##

1. The bare minimum code needed to create a Shiny app:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

# Define UI ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  
)



# Define server logic ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  
}



# Run the app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```



### Layout ###

1. Shiny uses the function `fluidPage` to create a display that automatically adjusts to the dimensions of your user's browser window. 

a. You layout the user interface of your app by placing elements in the `fluidPage` function. 

b. The `ui` function below creates a user interface that has:

(1) a title panel

(2) a sidebar layout: includes a sidebar panel, and a main panel

```{r}

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  titlePanel("title panel"),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel("sidebar panel"),
    mainPanel("main panel")
    
  )
)

```


2. `titlePanel` and `sidebarLayout` are the two most popular elements to add to `fluidPage`. They create a basic Shiny app with a sidebar. 

a. `sidebarLayout` always takes two arguments:

(1) `sidebarPanel` function output.

(a) The sidebar panel will appear on the left side of your app by default. You can move it to the right side by giving `sidebarLayout` the optional argument `position = "right"`. 

```{r}

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  titlePanel("title panel"),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    position = "right",
    sidebarPanel("sidebar panel"),
    mainPanel("main panel")
    
  )
)

```


(2) `mainPanel` function output. 

These functions place content in either the sidebar or the main panels. 


3. `titlePanel` and `sidebarLayout` create a basic layout for your Shiny app, but you can also create more advanced layouts. 

a. Use `navbarPage` to give your app a multi-page user interface that includes a navigation bar. 

b. Use `fluidRow` and `column` to build your layout up from a grid system. 
More advanced options are in the Shiny Application Layout Guide: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html



### HTML Content ###

1. You can add content to your Shiny app by placing it inside a `*Panel` function. 


2. To add more advanced content, use one of Shiny's HTML tag functions.

### Headers ###
1. To create a header element:

a. Select a header function (e.g. h1 or h5)

b. Give it the text you want to see in the header

> library(shiny)
> h1("My title")

<h1> My title </h1>


2. To place the element in your app:

a. Pass `h1("My title")` as an argument to `titlePanel`, `sidebarPanel`, or `mainPanel`.

The text will appear in the corresponding panel of your web page. 

b. You can place multiple elements in the same panel if you separate them with a comma. 


3. In general, any HTML tag attribute can be set as an argument in any Shiny tag function. 


### Formatted Text ###

1. Shiny offers many tag functions for formatting text. 



### Images ###

1. Shiny looks for the `img` function to place image files in your app. 

a. To insert an image, give the `img` function the name of your image file as the `src` argument (e.g. `img(src = "my_image.png")`). 
You must spell out this argument since `img` passes your input to an HTML tag, and `src` is what the tag expects. 

b. Can also include other HTML friendly parameters such as height and width. Note that height and width numbers will refer to pixels. 

2. The `img` function looks for your image file in a specific place. Your file must be in a folder named `www` in the same directory as the `app.R` script. 
a. Shiny treats this directory in a special way. Shiny will share any file placed here with your user's web browser, which makes `www` a great place to put images, style sheets, and other things the browser will need to build the web components of your SHiny app. 



### Other Tags ###

### Recap ###

1. You can:

a. Create a user interface with `fluidPage`, `titlePanel` and `sidebarLayout`.

b. Create an HTML element with one of Shiny's tag functions.

c. Set HTML tag attributes in the arguments of each tag function. 

d. Add an element to your web page by passing it to `titlePanel`, `sidebarPanel`, or `mainPanel`. 

e. Add multiple elements to each panel by separating them with a comma.

f. Add images by placing your image in a folder labeled `www` within your Shiny app directory and then calling the `img` function.
