# CH4 Matering the Grammar #

## 4.1 Introduction ##
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape)
library(ggpubr)
library(nlme)
```

1. __Theoretical Basis of ggplo2__:  the layered grammar of graphics. 

a. The grammar makes it easier for you to iteratively update a plot, changing a single feature at a time. 

b. The grammar is also useful as it suggests the high-level aspects of a plot that can be changed.

c. The grammar encourages the use of graphics customized to a particular problem, rather than relying on specific chart types. 



## 4.2 Building a Scatterplot ##

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point()
```


### 4.2.1 Mapping Aesthetics to Data ###

1. __Scatterplot__: represents each observation as a point, positioned according to the value of two ariables. As well as a horizontal and vertical position, each point also has a size, color and a shape. 


2. __Aesthetics__: attributes such as size, color, shape of a geom (i.e. point, line) are called aesthetics. They are the properties that can be perceived on the graphics. 

a. Each aesthetic can be mapped to __a variable__ OR set to __a constant value__.


3. __Geometric Objects (geoms)__: points, lines and bars are examples of geometric objects (or geoms). Geoms determine the "type" of the plot. 

a. Plots that use a single geom are often given a special name:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}
.tg .tg-cly1{text-align:left;vertical-align:middle}
.tg .tg-yla0{font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:middle}
.tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-yla0">Named Plot</th>
    <th class="tg-yla0">Geom</th>
    <th class="tg-yla0">Other Features</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-cly1">Scatterplot</td>
    <td class="tg-cly1">Point</td>
    <td class="tg-cly1"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-cly1">Bubblechart</td>
    <td class="tg-cly1">Point</td>
    <td class="tg-cly1">Size mapped to a variable</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Barchart</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Bar</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Box-and-whisker Plot</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Boxplot</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Line Chart</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Line</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax"></td>
  </tr>
</table>


b. More complex plots with combinations of multiple geoms do NOT have a special name and have to be described by words. 

__Example__ (Plot overlays a per group regression line on top of a scatterplot)

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color=factor(cyl)))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```


### 4.2.2 Scaling ###

1. __Scaling__: the conversion process that converts __data units__ (e.g. liters, miles per gallon, and number of cylinders) to __graphical units__ (e.g. pixels and colors) that computer can display. 

a. Scaling is performed by __scales__ function. 

b. __Aesthetic Specifications__: described in ``vignette ("ggplot2-specs")``:

(1) Colors are represented by a six-letter hexadecimal string. 

(2) Sizes are represented by a number.

(3) Shapes are represented by a integer. 

2. __Grid__: the drawying system that ggplot2 uses, it conducts a linear mapping from the range of the data to $[0,1]$. 

3. __Coord__: the coordinate system that determines how the two positions (x and y) are combined to form the final location on the plot. 

a. Cartesian coordinates (most commonly used)

b. Polar coordinates

c. Spherical projection (used for a map)


4. Colors can be though of as having three components, crresponding to the three types of color-detecting cells in the human eye. 

a. These three cell types give rise to a three-dimensional color space. 

b. Scaling then involves mapping the data values to points in this three-dimensional color space. 

(1) For discrete variables, the default scale maps the values of these discrete variables to evenly spaced hues on the color wheel.

5. To create a complete plot, we need to combine graphical objects from three sources:

a. __Data__: represented by geom

b. __Scales__ and __Coordinate System__: generates axes and legends so that we can read values from the graph

c. __Plot Annotations__: such as the background and plot title


## 4.3 Adding Complexity ##

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~year)
  
  
```


1. The __facets__ and __layers__ expand the data structure: each facet panel in each layer has its own dataset. 

a. Think of this as a 3d array: the panels of the facets form a 2d grid, and the layers extend upwards in the 3rd dimension. 

b. In this case the data in the layers is the same, but in general we can plot different datasets on different layers. 


2. The __smooth layer__ is different to the __point layer__ as it does NOT really display the raw data, but instead displays a __statistical transformation__ of the data. 

a. The smooth layer fits a smooth line through the middle of the data. 

(1) This requires an additional step in the process: after mapping the data to aesthetics, the data is passed to a statistical transformation, or __stat__, which manipulates the data in some useful way. 

(2) In the example above, the stat fits the data to a __loess smoother__, and then returns predictions from evenly spaced points within the range of the data. 

(3) Other useful stats include 1d and 2d binning, group means, quantile regression and contouring. 


3. Scaling occurs in 3 parts:

a. __Transforming__: scale transformation occurs before statistical transformation so that statistics are computed on the scale-transformed data. 

(1) There are many different transformations that can be used, including taking square roots, logarithms and reciprocals. 



b. __Training__: after the statistics are computed, each scale is trained on every dataset from all the layers and facets. 

(1) The training operation combines the ranges of the individual datasets to get the range of the complete data. 

(2) Without training, scales could only make sense locally and we would NOT be able to overlay different layers because their positions would NOT line up. 

(3) In some cases we may want to vary position scales across facets but we never want vary positions scales across layers. 


c. __Mapping__: the scales map the data values into aesthetics values.

(1) This is a local operation: the variables in each dataset are mapped to their aesthetic values, producing a new dataset that can then be rendered by the geoms.

## 4.4 Components of the Layered Grammar ##


1. Components that make up a plot:

a. Data

b. Aesthetic mappings

c. Geometric objects (geoms)

d. Statistical transformations (stats)

e. Scales

f. Facetting

g. Coordinate system

h. Position adjustment


2. __Position Adjustment__: deals with overlapping graphic objects. 

3. Together, the data, mappings, stat, geom and position adjustment form a __layer__. 

a. A plot may have multiple layers. 

b. The layered grammar defines a plot as the combination of:

(1) A default dataset and set of mappings from variables to aesthetics

(2) One or more layers, each composed of a geometric object, a statistical transformation, a position adjustment, and optionally, a dataset and aesthetic mappings. 

(3) One scale for each aesthetic mapping.

(4) A coordinate system.

(5) The facetting specification.


### 4.4.1 Layers ###

1. __Layers__: responsible for creating the objects that we perceive on the plot. 

a. A layer is composed of five parts:

(1) Data

(2) Aesthetic mappings

(3) A statistical transformation (stat)

(4) A geometric obejct (geom)

(5) A position adjustment


### 4.4.2 Scales ###

1. __Scale__: controls the ampping from data to aesthetic attributes, and we need a scale for every aesthetic used on a plot. 

a. Each scale operates across ALL the data in the plot, ensuring a consistent mapping from data to aesthetics. 

b. A scale is a function and its inverse (i.e. scale$=f+f^{-1}+$params), along with a set of parameters.

(1) The __parameters__ of the function define whether the path is linear or curved, which color space to use (e.g. LUV or RGB), and the colors at the start and end. 

(2) The __inverse function__ is used to draw a __guide__ so that you can read values from the graph. 

(a) Guides are either axes (for position scales) or legends (for everything else such as color, shape, etc.). 

(b) Most mappings have a unique inverse (i.e. the mapping function is one-to-one), but many do not. 

(c) A unique inverse makes it possible to recover the original data, but this is not alays desriable if we want to focus attention on a single aspect. 


c. Scaling is performed __before__statistical transformation.

### 4.4.3 Coordinate System ###

1. __Coordinate System (or coord)__: maps the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. 

a. Position is often specified by two coordinates (x,y), but potentially could be three or more (although this is not implemented in ggplo2). 

b. The Cartesia coordinate system is the most common coordinate system for two dimensions, while polar cooridnates and various map projections are used less frequently. 

c. Coordinate systems affect all position variables simultaneously and differ from scales in that they also change the appearance of the geometric objects. 

(1) For example, in polar coordinates, bar geoms look like segments of a circle. 

d. Coordinate transformations occured __after__ statistical transformation. 

e. Coordinate systems control how the axes and grid lines are drawn. 


### 4.4.4 Facetting ###

1. __Facetting__: a general case of conditioned or trellised plots. The facetting specification describes which varibales should be used to split up the data, and whether position scales should be free or constrained. 

a. Facetting makes it easy to create small multiples, each showing a different subset of the whole dataset. 

b. Facetting is a powerful tool when investigating whether patterns hold across all conditions.
