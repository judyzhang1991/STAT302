# CH6 Visualizing Amounts #

1. __Visualizing Amounts__: if we are interested in the magnitude of some set of numbers and we have a set of categories (e.g. brands of data, cities, or sports) and a quantitative value for each category. 

a. __Main Emphasis in These Visualizations__: the magnitude of the quantitative values. 

b. Standard visualization in this scenario is the __bar plot (or called bar chart)__. 

(1) __Variations of Bar Plot__: simple bars (one categorical variable), grouped bars, stacked bars. 

c. Alternative visualization to bar plot in this scenario are the __dot plot__ and the __heatmap__. 

## 6.1 Bar Plots ##

1. __Space Problem__: one common problem with vertical bars is that the labels identifying each bar take up a log of horizontal space. 

a. __First (Bad) Solution To save Horizontal Space__: place the bars closer together and rotate the labels. It will be awkward and difficult to read.

b. __Second (Better) Solution To Save Horizontal Space__: swap the ``x`` and the ``y`` axis, s.t. the bars run horizontally. This results in a compact figure in which all visual elements, including all text, are horizontally oriented.

1. __Order of the Bars Problem__: need to pay attention to the order in which the bars are arranged Arrange bars by arbitrary arrangements (e.g. alphabetic) can result in more confusing and less intuitive figures than __figures where bars are arranged in order of their size__. 


a. If there is a __natural order__ (i.e. when categorical variable is an __order factor__), should retain that natural order in the visualization.

b. Only rearrange bars when there is NO natural ordering to the categories the bars represent. If the bars represent unordered categories, order them by __ascending or descending data values__. 


## 6.2 Grouped and Stacked Bars ##

1. __Grouped Bar Plot__: can be used when interested in two categorical variables at the same time. In a grouped bar plot, draw a group of bars at each position along the ``x`` axies, determined by one categorical variable, and then we draw bars within each group according to another categorical variable.
