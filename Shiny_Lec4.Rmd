## Lession 4 Display Reactive Output ##


1. Reactive Output: automatically responds when your user toggles a widget. 


### Two Steps ###

1. You can create reactive output with a two step process.

a. Add an R object to your user interface. 

b. Tell Shiny how to build the object in the server function. The object will be reactive if the code that builds it calls a widget value. 


### Step 1: Add an R object to the UI

1. Shiny provides a family of functions that turn R objects into output for your user interface. Placing a function in `ui` tells Shiny where to display your object. 

a. Each function creates a specific type of output.

b. You can add output to the user interface in the same way that you added HTML elements and widgets. 

c. Place the output function inside `sidebarPanel` or `mainPanel` in the `ui`. 

__Example__

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("censusVis"),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      helpText("Create demographic maps with 
               information from the 2010 US Census."),
      
      selectInput("var", 
                  label = "Choose a variable to display",
                  choices = c("Percent White", 
                              "Percent Black",
                              "Percent Hispanic", 
                              "Percent Asian"),
                  selected = "Percent White"),
      
      sliderInput("range", 
                  label = "Range of interest:",
                  min = 0, max = 100, value = c(0, 100))
    ),
    
    mainPanel(
      textOutput("selected_var")
    )
  )
)
```


d. Each of the `*Output` functions require a single argument a character string that Shiny will use as the name of your reactive element. 

(1) Your user will not see this name, but you will use it later. 


### Step 2: Provide R code to build the object ###

1. Tell Shiny how to build the object: provide the R code that builds the object in the `server` function. 

a. The `server` function plays a special role in the Shiny process, it builds a list-like object named `output` that contains all of the code needed to update the R objects in your app. 

(1) Each R object needs to have its own entry in the list. 

b. You can create an entry by defining a new element for `output` within the `server` function. 

(1) The element name shoudl match the name of the reactive element that you created in the `ui` in the `server` function.


```{r}

# The output$selected_var matches textOutput("selected_var") in ui

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$selected_var <- renderText({ 
    "You have selected this"
  })
  
}

```


c. You do not need to explicitly state in the `server` function to return `output` in its last line of code. 

(1) R will automatically update `output` through reference class semantics. 

d. Each entry to `output` should contain the output of one of Shiny's `render*`functions.

(1) These functions caputure an R expression and do some light pre-processing on the expression. 

(2) Use the `render*` function that corresponds to the type of reactive object you are making.

e. Each `render*` function takes a single argument an R expression surrounded by braces, `{}`. The expression can be one simple line of text, or it can involve many lines of code, as if it were a complicated function call. 

f. This R expression is a set of instructions that you give Shiny to store for later. Shiny will run the instructions when you first launch your app, and then Shiny will re-run the instructions every time if needs to update your object. 



### Using Widget Values ###

1. You can make the text reactive by asking Shniy to call a widget value when it builds the text. 

a. In the `server` function, the argument `input` is a second list-like object. It stores the current values of all of the widgets in your app. These values will be saved under the names that you gave the wdigets in your `ui`. 

b. Shiny will automatically make an object reactive if the object uses an `input` value. 


__Example__
```{r}
# The server function creates a reactive lien of text by calling the values of the select box widget to build the text. 
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$selected_var <- renderText({ 
    paste("You have selected", input$var)
  })
  
}
```


2. Shiny tracks which outputs depend on which wdigets. 

a. When a user chagnes a widget, Shiny will rebuild all of the outputs that depend on the widget, using the new value of the widget as it goes. As a result, the result objects will be completely up-to-date. 


### Launch your app and see the reactive output ###

1. When you are ready, update your `server` and `ui` functions to match those above. 

2. Then launch your Shiny app by running `runApp("census-app", display.mode = "showcase")` at the command line. 

3. Watch the `server` portion of the script. When Shiny rebuilds an output, it highlights the code it is running. 


### Recap ###
1. Creating your first reactive Shiny app:

a. Use an `*Output` function in the `ui` to place reactive objects in your Shiny app. 

b. Use a `render*` function in the `server` to tell Shiny how to build your objects. 

c. Surround R expressions by curly braces, `{}`, in each `render*` function. 

d. Save your `render*` expressions in the `output` list, with one entry for each reactive object in your app.

e. Create reactivity by including an `input` value in a `render*` expression.
