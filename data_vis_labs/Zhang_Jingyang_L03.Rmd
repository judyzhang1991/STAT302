# Overview

The goal of this lab is to continue the process of unlocking the power of `ggplot2` through constructing and experimenting with a few basic plots.

# Datasets

We'll be using data from the `BA_degrees.rda` and `dow_jones_industrial.rda` datasets which are already in the `/data` subdirectory in our **data_vis_labs** project. Below is a description of the variables contained in each dataset.

`BA_degrees.rda`

* `field` - field of study
* `year_str` - academic year (e.g. 1970-71)
* `year` - closing year of academic year
* `count` - number of degrees conferred within a field for the year
* `perc` - field's percentage of degrees conferred for the year

`dow_jones_industrial.rda`

* `date` - date
* `open` - Dow Jones Industrial Average at open
* `high` - Day's high for the Dow Jones Industrial Average
* `low` - Day's low for the Dow Jones Industrial Average
* `close` - Dow Jones Industrial Average at close
* `volume` - number of trades for the day

We'll also be using a subset of the BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) survey collected annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data can be found in the provided `cdc.txt` file --- place this file in your `/data` subdirectory. The dataset contains 20,000 complete observations/records of 9 variables/fields, described below.

* `genhlth` - How would you rate your general health? (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor)
* `exerany` - Have you exercised in the past month? (`1 = yes`, `0 = no`) 
* `hlthplan` - Do you have some form of health coverage? (`1 = yes`, `0 = no`) 
* `smoke100` - Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life time? (`1 = yes`, `0 = no`) 
* `height` -  height in inches
* `weight` - weight in pounds
* `wtdesire` - weight desired in pounds
* `age` - in years
* `gender` - `m` for males and `f` for females

# Exercises

Complete the following exercises.

<br>

### Exercise 1

Using `BA_degrees` dataset, recreate the following graphics as precisely as possible.

```{r, eval = TRUE}

load("data/BA_degrees.rda")

# Wrangling for plotting
ba_dat <- BA_degrees %>%
  # mean % per field
  group_by(field) %>%
  mutate(mean_perc = mean(perc)) %>%
  # Only fields with mean >= 5%
  filter(mean_perc >= 0.05) %>%
  # Organizing for plotting
  arrange(desc(mean_perc), year) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(field = fct_inorder(field))
```

<br>

##### Plot 1

```{r}
ggplot(ba_dat, aes(year, perc))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~field)+
  labs(x="Year", y="Proportion of degrees")
  
```



<br>

##### Plot 2

*Hints:*

- Transparency is 0.5
- Color used is`"red"`

```{r}

ggplot(ba_dat, aes(year, perc))+
  # the order of geoms matters
  geom_area(fill="red", alpha=0.5)+
  geom_line(color="red")+
  facet_wrap(~field)+
  labs(x="Year", y="Proportion of degrees")


```


<br>

##### Plot 3

```{r}

ggplot(ba_dat, aes(year, perc, color=field))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(x="Year", y="Proportion of degrees")
 

```


<br>

### Exercise 2

Using `dow_jones_industrial` dataset, recreate the following graphics as precisely as possible. *Hint:* Used `close`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}

load("data/dow_jones_industrial.rda")


# Restrict data to useful range
djia_date_range <- dow_jones_industrial %>%
  filter(date >= ymd("2008/12/31") & date <= ymd("2010/01/10"))

```

<br>

##### Plot 1

*Hints:*

- Colors used `"red"`, `"purple"`, & `"green"`

```{r}
ggplot(djia_date_range, aes(date, close))+
  geom_line(color="purple")+
  geom_smooth(color="green", fill="red")+
  # Do not use x="" because it still allocates space on the plot
  labs(x=NULL, y="Dow Jones Industrial Average")
```


<br>

##### Plot 2

*Hints:*

- Wiggliness for `loess` is 0.3

```{r}
ggplot(djia_date_range, aes(date, close))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_smooth(span=0.3, se=FALSE)+
  labs(x=NULL, y="Dow Jones Industrial Average")
  
```


<br>

##### Plot 3

*Hints:*

- `y ~ ns(x, 6)` will need `splines` package (`"lm"` will work) 

```{r}

ggplot(djia_date_range, aes(date, close))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", formula=y~ns(x,6), se=FALSE)+
  labs(x=NULL, y="Dow Jones Industrial Average")
```


<br>

### Exercise 3

Using `cdc` dataset, recreate the following graphics as precisely as possible.

```{r cdc, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Read in the cdc dataset
cdc <- read_delim(file = "data/cdc.txt", delim = "|") %>%
  mutate(genhlth = factor(genhlth,
    levels = c("excellent", "very good", "good", "fair", "poor")
  ))
```

<br>

##### Plot 1

Construct this plot in two ways. Once using `cdc` and once using the `genhlth_count`.

```{r}
genhlth_count <- cdc %>%
  count(genhlth)
```



Use ``cdc``:
```{r}

ggplot(cdc, aes(genhlth))+
  geom_bar()

```



Use ``genhlth_count``:

```{r}
ggplot(genhlth_count, aes(genhlth, n))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  labs(y="count")
  
```


<br>



<br>

##### Plot 2

```{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(genhlth, fill=as.factor(hlthplan)))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge")
  
```



<br>

##### Plot 3

*Hints:*

- Transparency is 0.2

```{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(weight, fill=genhlth, color=genhlth))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2)+
  facet_wrap(~gender)
```


<br>

##### Plot 4

*Hints:*

- Transparency is 0.5
- Horizontal axis should have lower limit of 50 and upper limit of 300

```{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(weight, fill=gender, color=gender))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.5)+
  facet_wrap(~genhlth, ncol = 2)+
  xlim(50, 300)
```


<br>

##### Plot 5

*Hints:*

- Transparency is 0.4

```{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(gender, height, fill=gender))+
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.4)+
  facet_wrap(~genhlth, ncol = 5)
```

<br>

##### Plot 6

*Hints:*

- Transparency is 0.2
```{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(height, weight, color=gender))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.2)+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", formula=y~x, se=FALSE, fullrange=TRUE)
```
