## Overview

The goal of this lab is to explore ways to manage and manipulate scales, axes, and legends within `ggplot2`. 

## Datasets

We'll be using the `tech_stocks.rda`, `cdc.txt`, and a few toy datasets.

<br>

```{r load-packages-data-seed, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load package(s)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
# Load datasets
load("data/tech_stocks.rda")

# Read in the cdc dataset
cdc <- read_delim(file = "data/cdc.txt", delim = "|") %>%
  mutate(genhlth = factor(genhlth,
    levels = c("excellent", "very good", "good", "fair", "poor")
  ))

# Set seed
set.seed(8221984)

# Selecting a random subset of size 100
cdc_small <- cdc %>% sample_n(100)

# Generating toy datasets for exercise 2
dat1 <- tibble(theta = c(0, 2 * pi))

dat2 <- tibble(
  theta = seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100),
  obs = rnorm(100, sin(theta), 0.1),
  larger_than = ifelse(abs(obs) < abs(sin(theta)), "1", "0")
)
```

<br>

## Exercises

Complete the following exercises.

<br>

### Exercise 1

Using the `tech_stocks` dataset, recreate the following graphic as precisely as possible.

*Hints:*

- Size of lines in legend is 1.3
- 0.75 and 0.85 will be useful

<br>

```{r}


ggplot(tech_stocks, aes(date, price_indexed, color = company)) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9"))
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.background=element_blank(), legend.position = c(0.75, 0.85), legend.title = element_blank()) 
  


```




<br>

### Exercise 2

Use the toy datasets `dat1` and `dat2` to recreate the following graphic as precisely as possible.

*Hints:*

- Sizes used 2 (points) and 1.3 (line)
- Transparency 0.8
- Colors: `#56B4E9`, `darkgreen`, & `red`

<br>



<br>

### Exercise 3

Using `cdc_small`construct a scatterplot of `weight` by `height` with the following requirements: 

- Size of plotting characters should be 3.
- Color and shape should both identify `genhlth`.
- One legend for both color and shape.
- Legend title should be "General Health?" with a newline starting after general.
- Legend categories should be ordered from excellent (top) to poor (bottom) with each word in category capitalized in the legend.
- Legend should be placed in the lower right-hand corner of the plotting area. 
- Color should follow the `"Set1"` pallete.
- Shape should have a solid triangle (17) for excellent, solid circle (19) for very good, an `x` (4) for poor, an hollow rotated square with an `x` in it (9) for fair, and a solid square (15) for good.
- `height` values should be limited between 55 and 80.
- `height` axis should display every 5th number between 55 and 80 and be appropriately labeled (i.e. `55 in`, `60 in`, ..., `80 in`). No axis title is necessary.
- `weight` values should be limited between 100 and 300. 
- `weight` axis should be on log base 10 scale, but still display weights in pounds starting at 100 and displaying every 25 pounds until 300. Must be appropriately labeled (i.e. `100 lbs`, `125 lbs`, ..., `300 lbs`). No axis title is necessary.
- Graph title should be `CDC BRFSS: Weight by Height`.
- Minimal theme.
